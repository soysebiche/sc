# Taste-Skill (High-Agency Frontend)

This project gives your AI (like in Antigravity, Cursor, Codex, Claude Code) good taste. It stops the AI from generating boring, generic, "slop" code and forces it to build modern, high-end interfaces.

Right now, this whole system runs on just one single file: `SKILL.md`.


## IMPORTANT: Feedback & Contributions

## How to Install

You don't need to clone this whole project or do any complex setup. You just need the file.

1. Download the `SKILL.md` file from this repository.
2. Put it into your project folder.
3. Tell your AI (in your prompt or chat): *"Please read and strictly follow the rules in `SKILL.md`."* (In editors like Cursor, you can just `@SKILL.md`).

That's it. The AI will read the file and instantly upgrade how it writes frontend code.

## The 3 Control Dials

At the very top of `SKILL.md`, you will find three settings. They look like this:
* `DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`
* `MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`
* `VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`

You can change these numbers from `1` to `10` depending on what you want to build. Here is what they actually do:

### 1. DESIGN_VARIANCE (1 to 10)
This controls how crazy or normal the layout looks.
* **1 to 3 (Normal):** Very safe, centered layouts. Standard grids where everything lines up perfectly.
* **4 to 7 (Creative):** Things overlap a bit. Text might be pushed to the side, images have different sizes.
* **8 to 10 (Wild):** Asymmetric layouts, huge empty spaces, masonry grids. Very artsy and modern.

### 2. MOTION_INTENSITY (1 to 10)
This controls how much stuff moves on the screen.
* **1 to 3 (Static):** Almost no movement. Just simple color changes when you hover over a button.
* **4 to 7 (Smooth):** Nice fade-ins when the page loads. Smooth scrolling.
* **8 to 10 (Cinematic):** Buttons that magnetic-pull to your mouse. Elements that pop in with spring physics. Advanced scrolling effects.

### 3. VISUAL_DENSITY (1 to 10)
This is all about "Room to Breathe". It controls how much stuff is packed onto one screen.

* **1 to 3 (The "Art Gallery" Mode):** 
  Everything has huge space. One big photo, one big title. You have to scroll to see the next thing. This feels expensive and high-end, like a luxury brand (Apple, Gucci).
* **4 to 7 (The "Daily App" Mode):** 
  Normal spacing. Like Instagram or a news site. Not too crowded, but you can see enough.
* **8 to 10 (The "Cockpit" Mode):** 
  Everything is tiny and packed together. No big cards, just thin lines and lists. You can see 100 numbers and stats at once without scrolling. This is for pros (Trading apps, Dashboards, Sci-Fi interfaces).
